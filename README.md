<h1>Personal Portfolio</h1>
<p>
  Here is my pesonal portfolio website, using react with dark mode and light mode built in.
  The app first checks if you've been to the site by checking for a theme key in local storage, then sets the theme
  If you haven't then it checks your systems default theme settings, and saves that to local storage,
  and sets the theme to light or dark accordingly. The websites styling was done with <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>
  which was also used to make a custom modal, to show the Resume when clicked on.
