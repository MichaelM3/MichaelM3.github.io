<h1>Personal Portfolio</h1>
<p>
  Here is my pesonal portfolio website, using react with dark mode and light mode built in.
  The app first checks if you've been to the site using local storage, and then sets the theme.
  If you haven't then it checks your systems default theme settings, and saves that to local storage,
  and sets the theme to light or dark accordingly.
